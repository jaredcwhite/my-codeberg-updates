# 👨🏻‍💻 My Codeberg Updates

📜 **Codeberg Activity Feed:** https://codeberg.org/jaredwhite?tab=activity

Publishing my updates on Codeberg for the GitHub social feed! Yes, GitHub is sort of like a social network for coders, and I realized one downside to moving most of my work to Codeberg is folks here miss out on my updates in their feed. So I'll be merging PRs here on a semi-regular basis to keep you informed. **Follow me and star this repo** to get those updates in your feed!
